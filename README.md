# Mock Wordle

## Project Overview
Mock Wordle is a simple implementation of the popular Wordle game that I created spontaneously one night when I couldn't sleep. The entire project was completed within 1 or 2 hours, showcasing a functional word-guessing game with all the core features of Wordle. The goal of this project was to create a fun, engaging game using core web languages in a short period of time.

## Gameplay Goal
The objective of Mock Wordle is to guess a 5-letter word with the following visual clues:
- **Green**: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- **Orange**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Grey**: The letter is not found in the word at all.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Features
- Classic Wordle features with color-coded clues to guide players in guessing the 5-letter word.
- Simple and responsive design for a smooth gameplay experience.
